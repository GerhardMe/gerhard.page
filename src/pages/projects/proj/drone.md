In 2013 I got inspired to build my own drone. It was a really fun experience and taught me a lot about drones, but even more about compleating projects in itself. I closely followed this [guide](https://nrkbeta.no/2011/10/13/slik-bygger-du-ditt-eget-quadkopter-del-1/) thughout the project witch made it quite managable.

I started with building the frame out of an old coat rack. Steel legs and a plastic food container for housing the electronics. We are talking qute the DIY feel indeed. I remebre the drone beeing rather heavy, and quite scary. I dont remeber how long i spent builing it together, but i do remeber how long it flew.

I had configured the thrust controlls upside down without knowing it. The fist time I switched on the drone inside, i therefore rather quickly learned of my mistake. Not only was the thust upside down, but also the onboard gyroscope. I remeber the scene like this. I switched on the drone first. This part went without fault. Them I switched on the remote. The remote at once told the drone to go to full speed. The drone did so, but as soon as it left the ground, the onboard computer also told itself that it was upside down. This would have fact been usefull if the drone was upside down. However as the drone was not upside down it procived at full speed to flip over and start trying to fly its way down to china thugh the hard wood floor.

I dont really rember what happened next to well, but somwhere in my panic I got a large pillow and jumped on the drone trying to stangle it dead. I ripped out the battery and finnaly got it under controll. 

One couls say it was quite a lot of building for a rather short flight. Still, I was not quite defeated yet. I needed to rebuld mutch of the drone as you can see, and decided to build it more sturdy out of wood. However the dence wood i used was even more heavy then the metal frame, and V2 never got off the ground. 

V3 was built with a custum carbonfiber frame. A lot lighter and a lot meaner. I do remeber begging it in the air and caucesly flying it around. However I did relice that building the drone had always been mutch more fun then flying it, and I never bothered mutch with the flight.

I ended upp using the parts for some other viechles and a rather creating flying car powered by the gorund effect. Since then i never flew the drone, but i recently found the parts again. Perhaps its time to revisit the hobby. I emagine some smarter controllers could be fun to play around with.
