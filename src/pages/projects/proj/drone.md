In 2013 I got inspired to build my own drone. It was a really fun experience and taught me a lot about drones, but even more about completing projects in itself. I closely followed this [guide](https://nrkbeta.no/2011/10/13/slik-bygger-du-ditt-eget-quadkopter-del-1/) throughout the project which made it quite manageable.

I started with building the frame out of an old coat rack. Steel legs and a plastic food container for housing the electronics. We are talking quite the DIY feel indeed. I remember the drone being rather heavy, and quite scary. I don't remember how long I spent building it together, but I do remember how long it flew.

I had configured the thrust controls upside down without knowing it. The first time I switched on the drone inside, I therefore rather quickly learned of my mistake. Not only was the thrust upside down, but also the onboard gyroscope. I remember the scene like this. I switched on the drone first. This part went without fault. Then I switched on the remote. The remote at once told the drone to go to full speed. The drone did so, but as soon as it left the ground, the onboard computer also told itself that it was upside down. This would have in fact been useful if the drone was upside down. However as the drone was not upside down it proceeded at full speed to flip over and start trying to fly its way down to China through the hardwood floor.

I don't really remember what happened next too well, but somewhere in my panic I got a large pillow and jumped on the drone trying to strangle it dead. I ripped out the battery and finally got it under control.

One could say it was quite a lot of building for a rather short flight. Still, I was not quite done yet. I compleatly rebulit the drone, and this time out of hard wood. However the dense wood I used was even more heavy than the metal frame, and V2 never got off the ground.

V3 was built with a custom carbon fiber frame. A lot lighter and a lot meaner. I do remember getting it in the air and cautiously flying it around. However I did realise that building the drone had always been much more fun than flying it, and I never bothered much with the flight.

I ended up using the parts for some other vehicles and a rather creative flying car powered by the ground effect. Since then I never flew the drone, but I recently found the parts again. Perhaps it's time to revisit the hobby. I imagine some smarter controllers could be fun to play around with.
