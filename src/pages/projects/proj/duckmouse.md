At NTNU I joined a student organisation called [DotKom](https://wiki.online.ntnu.no/en/historie/dotkom/). There I met [Isak](https://isak.me/). One day Isak would tell me of a computermouse he had found online. A mouse with a small compartment of oil with a small rubber duck floating inside. As you can se this mouse was peraps the coolest comuptermouse in the world. The only problem was however, that not only was it out of stock, but it was out of production as well. After some contemplating we reliced that even though nooone else was selling theese mice, why coul'nt we?

## Website

We started with the website. Mainly becouse this was the least difficult. We also wanted the tec stack to be lightweight and intresting. Isak had some experience with Gatsby so we went with that. We wanted the styling to be uniqe and made by hand so we went with tailwind for managng CSS.

**Tec stack:**
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) 

Or GRTT as the cool kids say. I can not be said to have become a huge fan of gatsby, but it worked well for the project and was technicly interesting to work with. I then set upp the domain, as I had no previus experience with this. Although I had read about DNS and domainnames, actually setting it upp was a nice way to anker the knowlage. I also found out that one indevidual canno't own more than five '.no' domains.🙃 We initally wanted to use vipps for payment, but found it hard to sett upp as it requred uss to be an actuall company if i remeber correctly. We therefore decided on [stripe](https://stripe.com/en-no) instead. Other than that, the development was relativly straight forward. The website is still upp and running on [duckmouse.no](https://duckmouse.no/).

## Production

After we were more or less done with the site, we needed to get ahold of the actual computermice. After some reverse image searching and resurch we found the manufacturer on Alibaba. They smalest quanta they could manifature was 500, so that was the number we went with. Some would prehaps say this sounded a bit stupid as 500 is a lot. But some also say the earth is flat, so there is that.

## Entrepenuship
A big part of donig this project was learning about how one could go about selling a product. We tried to read upp on what we were legaly obliged to do and how to manage the income, expenses and so on. We figured that if we sold for less than 50,000nok in a year we were not obigated to pay VAT, but our earnings would obviusly be taxed as with a regular job. We bolth registred an "enkeltpersonforetak" and taxed thugh that.

Later that summer the boxes of computer mice apeared. When they arived at the door we started to understand the true scope of what we had done. It turnes out that 500 hundred of annything is rather a lot.

## Sales
We now only had one isue left. Selling theese mice. We started with quite a few sales to friends and friends of friends. We bought some stickers and gave them with the mouse. It quicly became apparent that even though I had found the prosess of building the website and buying the mice to be fun, selling them was mutch more tidius. Isak had quite a few good ideas on marketing, but we sadly never came round to do it. As of wrighting this post we have sold 48 of the total 500 mice.

There sadly apeard one tiny tiny problem. The mice have all started to leak oil. It turnes out that making coputer eqipment with oil inside is not a great idea. The mice were not well sealed and we slowly began understandng why nonoe else sold theese mice. We have tried to stop the leaking with a viraiaty of glues, but as of now we have found no fix. Duckmouse is therefore for now over and shut down. However the website is still upp, and who knows. Perhaps we figure out how to fix them or maby we find another usage for them all together.
