# Backstory

In 2021 I started using linux, In 2022 I was on Arch, since then I have tried around 10 different distoes and setupps. Everything from LARBS to ubuntu with some tails, fedora and Omarchy sprinkled in between. In late 2024 I was back to windows. Linux seemed like a perfect dream, but a dream nevertheless. Always breaking or uncompattable. I love computers but an OS cannot be my entire life. I started contemplating giving inn and eating of the furbidden tree of the apple ecosystem, but just then a hand came down from above and showed me NixOS. I havent looked back since.

I Ended upp making a managment system on topp of NixOS that makes the already great NixOS system even simpler to use and maintain. Gerhard's NixOS Management System, or GNOMS for short. This is the philosophy and expiriences of building that system and on using linux in genneral.

This story begins in 2021. I had started my informatics studies and joind its development team. It was here I met Ankha. He said I needed some program for webdevelopment, and beeing naive and young i agreed to let him install somthing on my laptop. 10 minutes later he came back with a duel boot system running windows and Manjaro. It seems silly to wright, but I cannot overstate how thankfull i am for this. Not becouse linux is that cool, but rather becouse the linux philosophy and comunity has seriously changed my perspective on so many things from politics, econiomics, nature, engeneering and even human connection. Sounds dumb, but I am afraid its true.

Regardless, lets back upp to Manjaro agian. I quickly fell in love with the terminal. I was by no eans good with it, but even wrighting a simple cd or cat made me feel so in conroll of the computer. No longer did I feel like I asked the computer for help, now it felt like I comanded it. The machine became a tool rather then an usefull adversary. I actually understood thoose simple commands. I understood that the computer understood them and I could better predict the computers behaviour. This innsight was why I wanted to explore linux more. 

This was the first main reson I fell in love with linux. The way it taught you to work with your machine and not against it. Use it as a tool, not some mustical object of magic. This was also my resom for studying informatics. I wanted to understand the workings of a computer. Why are some programs faster then others? Where are the programs stored? Did computers really become slower with time? I stared to find some awnsers while using linux. Just as with new cars, what could have been done simply is now hidden behind large tutch screens. Clicking a simple button spawns a 60fps animation using upp GPU power. Hidden startupp programs lags down the CPU in endless useless tasks.

It did not take long before I broke my Manjaro setupp. It ate my wondows partition, and suddenly I had nether a working windows machine or a working manjaro partition. I then made the sane decition to repartition, but this time with arch, like Ankha, the cool disto.

Let me tell you Arch is cool. It has a sick logo, it could only be installed thugh the terminal and most importantly, you got to say you used it. All the cool kids use arch, and to be fair it has some real advanages. The userbase it huge, so everything is there. This is the most common problem with linux, some ranodm program just does not work on linux, but the arch comunity is no large it actually gets som respect from developers and most programs support arch. Its also forces you to custimizable, no initial GNOME or PLASMA. I made my fisrt i3 tiling setupp and felt like the coolest hackerman there ever was. 

This leads my to my second reson I stuck with linux. Tiling managers. Shure windows has some tiling controlls and mac might have somthing similar, but the purity of i3, dwm, and awsomeWM can simply not be beat. You may think marginally faster swithcing between tasks seems trivial, but I beg to disagree. I fould myself not using my large external monitors anymore, I found myself able to have multiple simultanius projects open on my machine without it becoming messy. This compleatly revolusinised how I used a computer. The lightness of the smaller tiling managers made old laptops suddelny lighting fast and it even made me sell my tower pc. Suddenly i reliced that computers never get slower, porograms just become heavier, and since then I never bought another computer again. My old laptops just as quick as the day i got them.

Back to the story. I did get a semifunctional arch system with i3, and used that for development. However at that time, I barly knew what i was dooing and needed my windowspartition to everythingg non code related. I beleve i ended upp dooing an rm -rf/* n the root directory after i genuinly thought i was somewhere else on the machine. sufice to say, I rebuilt my arch. I really wanted to go deeper into arch and decided to remove the windows partition and go full arch. Never go full arch!

I rember barly compleating my exsams, with borrowing machines and frantlcy trying to get propiotary programs needed for exsams on my machine. Not recomended. Again my arch ended upp breaking. If I remeber correctly this time it was less my fault and i got some dependency hell i was not able to resolve. Defeated I returned to windows.

After spening some time hating how slow windows was and developing a deep hatred for the start menu. Why the heck is there advertizments in an operating system i bought? how is that even leagal?! I ended upp wanting to return to linux. However having learnd from my previus mistakes i ideally did not want to tutch my funtional laptopp at all. I ended upp not having to.
