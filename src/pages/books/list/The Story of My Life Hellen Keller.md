### Review

I read this a long time ago, so it's rather telling that I still remember it so well. I remember reading about the first time she understood touch language while touching flowing water. I find it fascinating how she describes herself running around to learn the name of everything, as though she had been waiting for a language all her life. I find it remarkable that, born deaf and blind, the human mind still breaks free, and in her case has the ability to touch millions.
