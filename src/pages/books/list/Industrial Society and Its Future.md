blurb: Industrial Society and Its Future, also known as the Unabomber Manifesto, is a 1995 anti-technology essay by Ted Kaczynski. The manifesto contends that the Industrial Revolution forces humans to adapt to machinery, creating a sociopolitical order that suppresses human potential and freedom. The roughly 35,000-word manifesto formed the ideological foundation of Kaczynski's 1978–1995 mail bomb campaign, designed to hasten the collapse of industrial society.
