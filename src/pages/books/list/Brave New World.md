blurb: Brave New World is a dystopian novel by English author Aldous Huxley, written in 1931, and published in 1932. Largely set in a futuristic World State, whose citizens are environmentally engineered into an intelligence-based social hierarchy, the novel anticipates huge scientific advancements in reproductive technology, sleep-learning, psychological manipulation and classical conditioning that are combined to make a dystopian society which is challenged by the story's protagonist. This novel is often used as a companion piece, or inversion counterpart to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four.

### Rewiew

Reading this book is like looking at our society through the eyes of the past. It's scary how much its world describes our modern society in the more subtle parts. Sure, we don't grow humans in labs, and we don't have castes of intelligence, but removal from death, hedonistic lifestyles, lack of purpose and real connection. All hail Henry Ford, the great commercializer. I found it truly thought-provoking and a great critique of modernity without overstating the obvious.
