blurb: The Denial of Death is a 1973 book by American cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker which discusses the psychological and philosophical implications of how people and cultures have reacted to the concept of death. The author argues most human action is taken to ignore or avoid the inevitability of death. It was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 1974, two months after the author's death. It is the main work responsible for the development of terror management theory, which provides empirical support for Becker's ideas.

### Rewiew

The contectual framwork of 1973, the insistance on taking Freud seriusly, the almost biblical sterness of it all. I love it! Time and time again, i found myself going, OMG thats it! Why is sex really tabu? Why do we cloth ourself? Why is it natuural to joake about poo and pee. I think this book has a really compelling awnser.
