blurb: Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality is a work of fan fiction and adapts the story of Harry Potter to explain concepts in cognitive science, philosophy, and the scientific method. Yudkowsky's reimagining supposes that Harry's aunt Petunia Evans married an Oxford professor and homeschooled Harry in science and rational thinking, allowing Harry to enter the magical world with ideals from the Age of Enlightenment and an experimental spirit. It is connected to the contemporary rationalist community and is popular among rationalists and effective altruists.
