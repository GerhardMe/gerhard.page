blurb: The Master and Margarita was written in the Soviet Union between 1928 and 1940. A censored version, with several chapters cut by editors, was published in 1966. The story concerns a visit by the devil and his entourage to the Soviet Union. The devil challenges the Soviet citizens beliefs towards religion and condemns their behavior throughout the book. It combines supernatural elements with satirical dark comedy and Christian philosophy. Many critics consider it to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, and the foremost of Soviet satires.
