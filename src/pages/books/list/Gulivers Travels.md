The novel satirises human nature and the imaginary "travellers' tales" literary subgenre. Gulliver's Travels is one of the most famous classics of both English and world literature, and popularised the fictional island of Lilliput. The poet John Gay remarked of the work, "It is universally read, from the cabinet council to the nursery." Although the novel is popularly classified under children's literature, Swift had originally written it as a political satire.
